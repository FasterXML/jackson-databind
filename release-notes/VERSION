 (since databinding is format-agnostic)

INCOMPATIBILITIES: (rats!)

* Note that [Issue#33] (see above) is, technically speaking, backwards
  imcompatible change. It is estimated that it should NOT affect most
  users, as changes are to edge cases (and undocumented ones at that).
  However, it can potentially cause problems with upgrade.
* Implementation of `JsonFormatVisitable` resulting in 2 new methods
  being added in `BeanPropertyFilter` interface -- this is unfortunate,
  but was required to support full traversability.
