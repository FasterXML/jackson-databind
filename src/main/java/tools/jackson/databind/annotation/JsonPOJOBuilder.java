/**
 * Annotation used to configure details of a Builder class:
 * instances of which are used as Builders for deserialized
 * POJO values, instead of POJOs being instantiated using
 * constructors or factory methods.
 * Note that this annotation is NOT used to define what is
 * the Builder class for a POJO: rather, this is determined
 * by {@link JsonDeserialize#builder} property of {@link JsonDeserialize}.
 *<p>
 * Annotation is typically used if the naming convention
 * of a Builder class is different from defaults:
 *<ul>
 * <li>By default, setters are expected to have names like `withName()` (for property "name");
 *     override by {@link #withPrefix()} property.
 *  </li>
 * </ul>
 *<p>
 * In addition to configuration using this annotation, note that many other configuration
 * annotations are also applied to Builders, for example
 * {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnoreProperties} can be used to ignore
 * "unknown" properties.
