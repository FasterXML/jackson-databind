	/**
	 * 6.2.1.  slash-delimited fragment resolution

		   With the slash-delimited fragment resolution protocol, the fragment
		   identifier is interpreted as a series of property reference tokens
		   that start with and are delimited by the "/" character (\x2F).  Each
		   property reference token is a series of unreserved or escaped URI
		   characters.  Each property reference token SHOULD be interpreted,
		   starting from the beginning of the fragment identifier, as a path
		   reference in the target JSON structure.  The final target value of
		   the fragment can be determined by starting with the root of the JSON
		   structure from the representation of the resource identified by the
		   pre-fragment URI.  If the target is a JSON object, then the new
		   target is the value of the property with the name identified by the
		   next property reference token in the fragment.  If the target is a
		   JSON array, then the target is determined by finding the item in
		   array the array with the index defined by the next property reference
		   token (which MUST be a number).  The target is successively updated
		   for each property reference token, until the entire fragment has been 
		   traversed.
		
		   Property names SHOULD be URI-encoded.  In particular, any "/" in a
		   property name MUST be encoded to avoid being interpreted as a
		   property delimiter.
		
		   For example, for the following JSON representation:
		
		   {
		     "foo":{
		       "anArray":[
		         {"prop":44}
		       ],
		       "another prop":{
		         "baz":"A string"
		       }
		     }
		   }
		
		   The following fragment identifiers would be resolved:
		
		   fragment identifier      resolution
		   -------------------      ----------
		   #                        self, the root of the resource itself
		   #/foo                    the object referred to by the foo property
		   #/foo/another%20prop     the object referred to by the "another prop"
		                            property of the object referred to by the
		                            "foo" property
		   #/foo/another%20prop/baz the string referred to by the value of "baz"
		                            property of the "another prop" property of
		                            the object referred to by the "foo" property
		   #/foo/anArray/0          the first object in the "anArray" array
		
		6.2.2.  dot-delimited fragment resolution
		
		   The dot-delimited fragment resolution protocol is the same as slash-
		   delimited fragment resolution protocol except that the "." character
		   (\x2E) is used as the delimiter between property names (instead of
		   "/") and the path does not need to start with a ".".  For example,
		   #.foo and #foo are a valid fragment identifiers for referencing the
		   value of the foo propery.

		 * The value of the "href" link description property indicates the
		   target URI of the related resource.  The value of the instance
		   property SHOULD be resolved as a URI-Reference per RFC 3986 [RFC3986]
		   and MAY be a relative URI.  The base URI to be used for relative
		   resolution SHOULD be the URI used to retrieve the instance object
		   (not the jsonSchema) when used within a jsonSchema.  Also, when links are
		   used within a jsonSchema, the URI SHOULD be parametrized by the property
		   values of the instance object, if property values exist for the
		   corresponding variables in the template (otherwise they MAY be
		   provided from alternate sources, like user input).
		
		   Instance property values SHOULD be substituted into the URIs where
		   matching braces ('{', '}') are found surrounding zero or more
		   characters, creating an expanded URI.  Instance property value
		   substitutions are resolved by using the text between the braces to
		   denote the property name from the instance to get the value to
		   substitute.  For example, if an href value is defined:
		
		   http://somesite.com/{id}
		
		   Then it would be resolved by replace the value of the "id" property
		   value from the instance object.  If the value of the "id" property
		   was "45", the expanded URI would be:

		   http://somesite.com/45
	 	
		   If matching braces are found with the string "@" (no quotes) between
		   the braces, then the actual instance value SHOULD be used to replace
		   the braces, rather than a property value.  This should only be used
		   in situations where the instance is a scalar (string, boolean, or
		   number), and not for objects or arrays.

		/**
		 * The value of the "rel" property indicates the name of the relation to
		   the target resource.  The relation to the target SHOULD be
		   interpreted as specifically from the instance object that the jsonSchema
		   (or sub-jsonSchema) applies to, not just the top level resource that
		   contains the object within its hierarchy.  If a resource JSON
		   representation contains a sub object with a property interpreted as a
		   link, that sub-object holds the relation with the target.  A relation
		   to target from the top level resource MUST be indicated with the
		   jsonSchema describing the top level JSON representation.
		
		   Relationship definitions SHOULD NOT be media type dependent, and
		   users are encouraged to utilize existing accepted relation
		   definitions, including those in existing relation registries (see RFC
		   4287 [RFC4287]).  However, we define these relations here for clarity
		   of normative interpretation within the context of JSON hyper jsonSchema
		   defined relations:
		
		   self  If the relation value is "self", when this property is
		      encountered in the instance object, the object represents a
		      resource and the instance object is treated as a full
		      representation of the target resource identified by the specified
		      URI.
		
		   full  This indicates that the target of the link is the full
		      representation for the instance object.  The object that contains
		      this link possibly may not be the full representation.
		
		   describedby  This indicates the target of the link is the jsonSchema for
		      the instance object.  This MAY be used to specifically denote the
		      schemas of objects within a JSON object hierarchy, facilitating
		      polymorphic type data structures.
		
		   root  This relation indicates that the target of the link SHOULD be
		      treated as the root or the body of the representation for the
		      purposes of user agent interaction or fragment resolution.  All
		      other properties of the instance objects can be regarded as meta-
		       data descriptions for the data.

		   The following relations are applicable for schemas (the jsonSchema as the
		   "from" resource in the relation):
		
		   instances  This indicates the target resource that represents
		      collection of instances of a jsonSchema.
		
		   create  This indicates a target to use for creating new instances of
		      a jsonSchema.  This link definition SHOULD be a submission link with a
		      non-safe method (like POST).
		
		   For example, if a jsonSchema is defined:
		
		   {
		     "links": [
		       {
		         "rel": "self"
		         "href": "{id}"
		       },
		       {
		         "rel": "up"
		         "href": "{upId}"
		       },
		       {
		         "rel": "children"
		         "href": "?upId={id}"
		       }
		     ]
		   }
		
		   And if a collection of instance resource's JSON representation was
		   retrieved:
		
		   GET /Resource/
		
		   [
		     {
		       "id": "thing",
		       "upId": "parent"
		     },
		     {
		       "id": "thing2",
		       "upId": "parent"
		     }
		   ]
		
		   This would indicate that for the first item in the collection, its
		   own (self) URI would resolve to "/Resource/thing" and the first
		   item's "up" relation SHOULD be resolved to the resource at
		   "/Resource/parent".  The "children" collection would be located at
		   "/Resource/?upId=thing".
