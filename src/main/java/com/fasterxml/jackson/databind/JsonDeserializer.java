/**
 * Abstract class that defines API used by {@link ObjectMapper} (and
 * other chained {@link JsonDeserializer}s too) to deserialize Objects of
 * arbitrary types from JSON, using provided {@link JsonParser}.
 *<p>
 * Custom deserializers should usually not directly extend this class,
 * but instead extend {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.StdDeserializer}
 * (or its subtypes like {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.StdScalarDeserializer}).
 *<p>
 * If deserializer is an aggregate one -- meaning it delegates handling of some
 * of its contents by using other deserializer(s) -- it typically also needs
 * to implement {@link #resolve}
 * which can locate dependant deserializers. This is important to allow dynamic
 * overrides of deserializers; separate call interface is needed to separate
 * resolution of dependant deserializers (which may have cyclic link back
 * to deserializer itself, directly or indirectly).
 *<p>
 * In addition, to support per-property annotations (to configure aspects
 * of deserialization on per-property basis), deserializers may want
 * to override
 * {@link #createContextual} which allows specialization of deserializers:
 * it is passed information on property, and can create a newly configured
 * deserializer for handling that particular property.
 *<br />
 * Resolution of deserializers occurs before contextualization.

     * Method that can be called to ask implementation to deserialize
     * JSON content into the value type this serializer handles.
     * Returned instance is to be constructed by method itself.
     *<p>
     * Pre-condition for this method is that the parser points to the
     * first event that is part of value to deserializer (and which 
     * is never JSON 'null' literal, more on this below): for simple
     * types it may be the only value; and for structured types the
     * Object start marker or a FIELD_NAME.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The two possible input conditions for structured types result
     * from polymorphism via fields. In the ordinary case, Jackson
     * calls this method when it has encountered an OBJECT_START,
     * and the method implementation must advance to the next token to
     * see the first field name. If the application configures
     * polymorphism via a field, then the object looks like the following.
     *  <pre>
     *      {
     *          "@class": "class name",
     *          ...
     *      }
     *  </pre>
     *  Jackson consumes the two tokens (the <tt>@class</tt> field name
     *  and its value) in order to learn the class and select the deserializer.
     *  Thus, the stream is pointing to the FIELD_NAME for the first field
     *  after the @class. Thus, if you want your method to work correctly
     *  both with and without polymorphism, you must begin your method with:
     *  <pre>
     *       if (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {
     *         p.nextToken();
     *       }
     *  </pre>
     * This results in the stream pointing to the field name, so that
     * the two conditions align.
     * <p>
     * Post-condition is that the parser will point to the last
     * event that is part of deserialized value (or in case deserialization
     * fails, event that was not recognized or usable, which may be
     * the same event as the one it pointed to upon call).
     *<p>
     * Note that this method is never called for JSON null literal,
     * and thus deserializers need (and should) not check for it.
     *
