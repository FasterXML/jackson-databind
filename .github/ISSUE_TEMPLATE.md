We appreciate issues as very valuable contributions, but just to make sure here are things that are important to do before filing an issue.

First, and foremost: THIS IS NOT A GENERAL-PURPOSES SUPPORT FORUM FOR ASKING QUESTIONS.
Such a place exixsts at:

    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jackson-user

so please go there for anything other than bug reports and feature/improvement suggestions.
You are more likely to get help that way (and we will promptly close questions-as-issues)

Also, we would appreciate if you:

* Check to see if this issue has already been reported (quick glance at existing issues)
    * no deep search necessary, just quick sanity check
* Include version information for Jackson version you use
* (optional but highly recommended) Verify that the problem occurs with the latest patch of same minor version; and even better, if possible, try using the latest stable patch version
    * For example: if you observe an issue with version `2.4.1`, first upgrade to `2.4.6` to ensure problem has not already been fixed.
