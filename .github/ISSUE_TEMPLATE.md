We appreciate issues as very valuable contributions, but just to make sure here are things that are important to do before filing an issue.

First, and foremost: THIS IS NOT A GENERAL-PURPOSES SUPPORT FORUM FOR ASKING QUESTIONS.
For questions you will instead want to use one of these resources

- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jackson-user
- https://gitter.im/FasterXML/jackson-databind

so please go there for anything other than bug reports and feature/improvement suggestions.
You are more likely to get help that way (we will usually close questions-as-issues)

We would also appreciate if you:

* Check to see if this issue has already been reported (quick glance at existing issues)
    * no deep search necessary, just a quick sanity check
* Include version information for Jackson version you use
* (optional but highly recommended) Verify that the problem occurs with the latest patch of same minor version; and even better, if possible, try using the latest stable patch version
    * For example: if you observe an issue with version `2.9.3`, first upgrade to `2.9.9` to ensure problem has not already been fixed.

With that, let's hear what problem you are having & thank you in advance for reporting it!
