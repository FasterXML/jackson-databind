INCOMPATIBILITIES: (rats!)

* Note that [Issue#33] (see above) is, technically speaking, backwards
  imcompatible change. It is estimated that it should NOT affect most
  users, as changes are to edge cases (and undocumented ones at that).
  However, it can potentially cause problems with upgrade.
* Implementation of `JsonFormatVisitable` resulting in 2 new methods
  being added in `BeanPropertyFilter` interface -- this is unfortunate,
  but was required to support full traversability.

2.0.4 (26-Jun-2012)

* [Issue#6]: element count for PrettyPrinter, endObject wrong

  SerializationConfig, DeserializationConfig) into per-factory
  features (MapperFeature, JsonFactory.Feature) an per
  instance features (existing ones)

  use of separate Builder object for data binding, creating actual value
* [JACKSON-608]: Allow use of JSON Views for deserialization
* [JACKSON-636]: Add 'SerializationFeature.ORDER_MAP_ENTRIES_BY_KEYS' to allow
  forced sorting of Maps during serialization
  (suggested by Joern H)
