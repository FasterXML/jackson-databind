/**
 * Abstract class that defines API used for introspecting annotation-based
 * configuration for serialization and deserialization. Separated
 * so that different sets of annotations can be supported, and support
 * plugged-in dynamically.
 *<p>
 * Although default implementations are based on using annotations as the only
 * (or at least main) information source, custom implementations are not limited
 * in such a way, and in fact there is no expectation they should be. So the name
 * is bit of misnomer; this is a general configuration introspection facility.
 *<p>
 * NOTE: due to rapid addition of new methods (and changes to existing methods),
 * it is <b>strongly</b> recommended that custom implementations should not directly
 * extend this class, but rather extend {@link NopAnnotationIntrospector}.
 * This way added methods will not break backwards compatibility of custom annotation
 * introspectors.
